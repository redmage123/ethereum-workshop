    "A good definition of a blockchain is a “Cryptographically secure transactional singleton machine with shared-state.”\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Cryptographically secure” means that the creation of digital currency is secured by complex mathematical algorithms that are very hard to break. These algorithms make it nearly impossible to cheat the system (e.g. create fake transactions, erase transactions, etc.)\n",
    "- “Transactional singleton machine” means that there’s a single canonical instance of the machine responsible for all the transactions being created in the system. In other words, there’s a single global truth that everyone believes in.\n",
    "- “With shared-state” means that the state stored on this machine is shared and open to everyone.\n",
